# The context spine for AI coding agents.

engram intercepts every file read your AI agent makes and replaces it with a pre-assembled context packet — structure, decisions, git history, library docs, and known issues — from 8 providers, delivered in a single ~500-token response. The agent gets what it needs without reading the file. You stop paying for context you've already paid for.

This is not a tool the agent calls. It hooks at the Claude Code tool boundary. Every `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, and `cat` is intercepted automatically.

```bash
npm install -g engramx
cd ~/my-project
engram init
engram install-hook
```

That's the full setup. The next Claude Code session starts with a project brief already loaded, file reads intercepted, and a live HUD showing cumulative savings.

---

## Dashboard

A zero-dependency web dashboard ships built-in. One command, opens in your browser:

```bash
engram ui
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/01-overview.png" alt="engram dashboard — Overview tab" width="100%">
</p>

The **Overview** tab: real metrics from your sessions — tokens saved, cost saved at $3/M rate, session-level hit rate, cache performance, graph health.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/03-activity.png" alt="engram dashboard — Activity tab" width="100%">
</p>

**Activity** — live hook events streamed via Server-Sent Events. See every `Read` / `Edit` / `Write` decision (deny = intercepted, passthrough = engram couldn't help). Per-tool breakdown on the right shows where the savings come from.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/04-files.png" alt="engram dashboard — Files heatmap" width="100%">
</p>

**Files** — the heatmap ranks your hot files by interception count. Cursor knows this view.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/05-graph.png" alt="engram dashboard — Knowledge graph visualization" width="100%">
</p>

**Graph** — Canvas 2D force-directed visualization of the knowledge graph. God nodes are larger and labeled. Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, click for details. 300+ nodes at 60fps.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/06-providers.png" alt="engram dashboard — Providers + cache health" width="100%">
</p>

**Providers** — component health (HTTP / LSP / AST / IDE count) and per-layer cache stats (entries + cross-session hit counts).

### Design

- **35KB total** — one HTTP response, zero external CDN calls, works offline and on air-gapped machines.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — all CSS and JS inlined as TypeScript template literals; SVG charts and Canvas 2D graph hand-rolled (~400 LOC total).
- **CSP-hardened** — `default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'` meta tag plus `esc()` at every data-to-HTML boundary. Defends against attacker-controlled file paths and labels mined from untrusted repos.
- **Live-updating** — SSE stream pushes new hook events to the Activity tab within 1 second.

See also the **Sessions** tab (cumulative breakdown + sparkline) in [`assets/screenshots/02-sessions.png`](assets/screenshots/02-sessions.png).

## Benchmark

Measured across 10 structured coding tasks against a baseline of reading the relevant files directly. No synthetic data. No cherry-picked queries.

| Task | Baseline (tokens) | engram (tokens) | Savings |
|------|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| task-01-find-caller | 4,500 | 650 | 85.6% |
| task-02-parent-class | 2,800 | 400 | 85.7% |
| task-03-file-for-class | 3,200 | 300 | 90.6% |
| task-04-import-graph | 6,800 | 900 | 86.8% |
| task-05-exported-api | 5,500 | 700 | 87.3% |
| task-06-landmine-check | 8,200 | 850 | 89.6% |
| task-07-architecture-sketch | 14,500 | 1,600 | 89.0% |
| task-08-refactor-scope | 9,200 | 1,100 | 88.0% |
| task-09-hot-files | 3,800 | 550 | 85.5% |
| task-10-cross-file-flow | 12,800 | 1,400 | 89.1% |
| **Aggregate** | **7,130** | **845** | **88.1%** |

Run the benchmark yourself: `engram bench` or `engram stress-test` for the full suite.

## What It Does

engram sits between your AI agent and the filesystem. When the agent reads a file, engram checks its knowledge graph. If the file is covered with sufficient confidence, it blocks the read and injects a compact context packet instead. The packet is assembled from up to 8 providers in parallel, all pre-cached at session start.

**The 8 providers:**

| Provider | Source | Confidence | Latency |
|----------|--------|:-----------:|:-------:|
| `engram:ast` | Tree-sitter parse (10 languages) | 1.0 | <50ms |
| `engram:structure` | Regex heuristics (fallback) | 0.85 | <50ms |
| `engram:mistakes` | Past failure nodes from graph | — | <10ms |
| `engram:git` | Co-change patterns, churn, authorship | — | <100ms |
| `mempalace` | Decisions, learnings, project context | — | <5ms cached |
| `context7` | Library API docs for detected imports | — | <5ms cached |
| `obsidian` | Project notes, architecture docs | — | <5ms cached |
| `engram:lsp` | Live diagnostics captured as mistake nodes | — | on-event |

External providers cache into SQLite at SessionStart. Per-read resolution is a cache lookup, not a live call. If a provider is unavailable it is skipped silently — you always get at least the structural summary.

**The 9 hook handlers:**

| Hook | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `PreToolUse:Read` | Blocks the read if file is covered. Delivers structural summary as the block reason. |
| `PreToolUse:Edit` | Passes through. Injects known mistakes as landmine warnings alongside the edit. |
| `PreToolUse:Write` | Same as Edit — advisory injection only, never blocks writes. |
| `PreToolUse:Bash` | Catches `cat \| head \| tail \| less \| more <single-file>` and delegates to the Read handler. |
| `SessionStart` | Injects a compact project brief (god nodes, graph stats, top landmines, git branch). Bundles MemPalace context in parallel. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Extracts keywords from the prompt, runs a budget-capped pre-query, injects results before the agent responds. |
| `PostToolUse` | Observer only. Writes to `.engram/hook-log.jsonl` for `hook-stats`. |
| `PreCompact` | Re-injects god nodes and active landmines right before Claude compresses the conversation. Survives compaction. |
| `CwdChanged` | Auto-switches project context when you navigate to a different repo mid-session. |

**Ten safety invariants enforced at runtime:**

1. Any handler error → passthrough (Claude Code is never blocked)
2. 2-second per-handler timeout
3. Kill switch (`.engram/hook-disabled`) respected by every handler
4. Atomic settings.json writes with timestamped backups
5. Never intercept outside the project root
6. Never intercept binary files or secrets (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, etc.)
7. Never log user prompt content (privacy invariant, asserted in tests)
8. Never inject more than 8,000 chars per hook response
9. Stale graph detection — file mtime newer than graph mtime → passthrough
10. Partial-read bypass — explicit `offset` or `limit` on Read → passthrough

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g engramx
```

Requires Node.js 20+. Zero native dependencies. No build tools. Local SQLite via sql.js WASM — no Rust, no Python, no system libs.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
cd ~/my-project
engram init                      # scan codebase → .engram/graph.db (~40ms, 0 tokens)
engram install-hook              # wire the Sentinel into Claude Code
engram ui                        # open the web dashboard in your browser
```

Open a Claude Code session. When the agent reads a well-covered file you will see a system-reminder with the structural summary instead of file contents. After the session:

```bash
engram hook-stats                # what was intercepted, tokens saved (CLI)
engram ui                        # same data, richer view, real-time updates
engram hook-preview src/auth.ts  # dry-run: see what the hook would inject for one file
```

**Full recommended setup (one-time per project):**

```bash
npm install -g engramx
cd ~/my-project
engram init --with-skills        # also index ~/.claude/skills/ into the graph
engram install-hook              # wire Sentinel into Claude Code
engram hooks install             # auto-rebuild graph on every git commit
```

**Experience tiers — each works standalone:**

| Tier | What you run | What you get |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Graph only | `engram init` | CLI queries, MCP server, `engram gen` for CLAUDE.md |
| + Sentinel | `engram install-hook` | Automatic Read interception, Edit warnings, session briefs, HUD |
| + Context Spine | Configure providers.json | Rich packets from all 8 providers per read |
| + Skills index | `engram init --with-skills` | Graph includes your `~/.claude/skills/` |
| + Git hooks | `engram hooks install` | Graph rebuilds on every commit, stays current |
| + HTTP server | `engram server --http` | REST API on port 7337 for external tooling |

---

## Install + Configuration

```bash
npm install -g engramx
```

**providers.json** (optional — auto-detection works for most setups):

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "mempalace": { "enabled": true },
    "context7": { "enabled": true },
    "obsidian": { "enabled": true, "vault": "~/vault" },
    "lsp": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

**Hook scope options:**

```bash
engram install-hook                  # default: .claude/settings.local.json (gitignored)
engram install-hook --scope project  # .claude/settings.json (committed)
engram install-hook --scope user     # ~/.claude/settings.json (global)
engram install-hook --dry-run        # preview changes without writing
engram install-hook --auto-reindex   # also keep the graph fresh after every Edit/Write/MultiEdit (#8)
```

**Kill switch (if anything goes wrong):**

```bash
engram hook-disable    # touches .engram/hook-disabled — all handlers pass through
engram hook-enable     # removes the kill switch
engram uninstall-hook  # surgical removal, preserves other hooks in settings.json
```

---

```

**Infrastructure:**

```bash
engram watch [path]              # live file watcher — incremental re-index on save
engram reindex <file>            # re-index one file (editor/hook/CI primitive, issue #8)

engram db status                 # schema version, migration state
engram init --from-ccs           # import from CCS-format context file
```

**Claude HUD integration:**

Add `--extra-cmd="engram hud-label"` to your statusLine command to see live savings:

```
engram 48.5K saved 75%
```

## HTTP API

Start the server with `engram server --http` (default port 7337).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Server health + graph stats |
| `POST` | `/query` | Query the knowledge graph |
| `GET` | `/gods` | Most connected entities |
| `GET` | `/stats` | Node/edge counts, confidence breakdown |
| `POST` | `/path` | Shortest path between two concepts |
| `GET` | `/mistakes` | Known failure nodes |
| `POST` | `/learn` | Add a decision or pattern |
| `POST` | `/init` | Trigger a graph rebuild |
| `GET` | `/hook-stats` | Hook interception log summary |

All responses are JSON. The server is local-only by default — bind address is `127.0.0.1`.

---

## MCP Server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engram": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "engramx", "serve", "/path/to/your/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

**MCP Tools (6):**

- `query_graph` — search the knowledge graph with natural language
- `god_nodes` — core abstractions (most connected entities)
- `graph_stats` — node/edge counts, confidence breakdown
- `shortest_path` — trace connections between two concepts
- `benchmark` — token reduction measurement
- `list_mistakes` — known failure modes from past sessions

**Shell wrapper (for Bash-based agents):**

```bash
cp scripts/mcp-engram ~/bin/mcp-engram && chmod +x ~/bin/mcp-engram
mcp-engram query "how does auth work" -p ~/myrepo
```

---

## ECP Spec

engram v1.0 ships the first draft of the **Engram Context Protocol** (ECP v0.1) — an open specification for how AI coding tools should package and exchange structured context packets.

The spec defines the wire format, provider negotiation, budget constraints, and confidence scoring used by engram internally. Any tool can implement the spec to produce or consume engram-compatible context packets.

**License:** CC-BY 4.0  
**Spec:** [`docs/specs/ecp-v0.1.md`](docs/specs/ecp-v0.1.md)

---

## Programmatic API

```typescript
import { init, query, godNodes, stats } from "engramx";

const result = await init("./my-project");
console.log(`${result.nodes} nodes, ${result.edges} edges`);

const answer = await query("./my-project", "how does auth work");
console.log(answer.text);

const gods = await godNodes("./my-project");
for (const g of gods) {
  console.log(`${g.label} — ${g.degree} connections`);
}
```
