/**
 * PreToolUse:Edit and PreToolUse:Write handler.
 *
 * Unlike the Read handler (which BLOCKS and returns a summary), this
 * handler NEVER blocks. Its only job is to surface landmine warnings
 * from the mistake graph when the agent is about to modify a file that
 * has known past failures.
 *
 * Mechanism: empirically verified PreToolUse `allow + additionalContext`
 * shape (v5 spike, 2026-04-11). Claude Code runs the Edit/Write normally
 * and delivers the warning alongside the tool result as a system-reminder.
 *
 * Decision matrix:
 *   - Missing file_path → passthrough
 *   - Content unsafe (binary/secret) → passthrough
 *   - Outside project → passthrough
 *   - Kill switch → passthrough
 *   - No mistakes for this file → passthrough (empty context adds no value)
 *   - Mistakes found → buildAllowWithContextResponse(warning)
 *
 * Safety invariant: this handler must NEVER return a deny response. The
 * whole point is to let writes proceed with context, not gate them.
